# Workout - Tracker

## Description

Did you gain the Covid 20? I know I did. (Please do NOT be embarrassed to admit it)

Gaining weight is easy but working out is harder. I created an application that allows you to log your exercise by the minute and the day. I find that I feel more motivated to work out when I can see some type of progress. I think you will find it helpful as well. 

Below you will see a few examples of how the application works. Click [here](https://stormy-fjord-73255.herokuapp.com/) to check out the deployed application.
